#Prerequisites
  To follow this tutorial, you will need the following:

  Ubuntu 16.04 Droplet
  Non-root user with sudo privileges (Initial Server Setup with Ubuntu 16.04 explains how to set this up.)

Note:-  All the commands in this tutorial should be run as a non-root user. If root access is required for the command, 
        it will be preceded by sudo. Initial Server Setup with Ubuntu 16.04 explains how to add users and give them sudo access.


#################Step 1 — Installing Python 2.7 and Pip#########################
  In this section we will install Python 2.7 and Pip.

  First, update the system’s package index. This will ensure that old or outdated packages do not interfere with the 
  installation.

  #sudo apt-get update
   Next, install Python 2.7, Python Pip, and Python Development:

  #sudo apt-get -y install python2.7 python-pip python-dev
  
  #Installing python2.7 will update to the latest version of Python 2.7, and python-pip will install Pip which allows 
  us to manage Python packages we would like to use. Some of Jupyter’s dependencies may require compilation, 
  in which case you would need the ability to compile Python C-extensions, so we are installing python-dev as well.
  
  To verify that you have python installed:

  #python --version
    This will output:
    Output
    Python 2.7.11+
    Depending on the latest version of Python 2.7, the output might be different.

  #You can also check if pip is installed using the following command:
    #pip --version
    You should something similar to the following:
    Output
    pip 8.1.1 from /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages (python 2.7)
    Similarly depending on your version of pip, the output might be slightly different.
    
 ############Step2 — Installing Ipython and Jupyter Notebook###################
 #In this section we will install Ipython and Jupyter Notebook.

  #First, install Ipython:
      #sudo apt-get -y install ipython ipython-notebook
    Now we can move on to installing Jupyter Notebook:
      #sudo -H pip install jupyter
    Depending on what version of pip is in the Ubuntu apt-get repository, you might get the following error when 
    trying to install Jupyter:

    #Output
    You are using pip version 8.1.1, however version 8.1.2 is available.
    You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.
    If so, you can use pip to upgrade pip to the latest version:
      #sudo -H pip install --upgrade pip
    Upgrade pip, and then try installing Jupyter again:
      #sudo -H pip install jupyter
###################Step 3 — Running Jupyter Notebook################################
  #You now have everything you need to run Jupyter Notebook! To run it, execute the following command:

  #jupyter notebook
  #If you are running Jupyter on a system with JavaScript installed, it will still run, but it might give you an error stating that the Jupyter Notebook requires JavaScript:
  #Output
  #Jupyter Notebook requires JavaScript.
  #Please enable it to proceed.
  ...
  #To ignore the error, you can press Q and then press Y to confirm.

  #A log of the activities of the Jupyter Notebook will be printed to the terminal. When you run Jupyter Notebook, 
  it runs on a specific port number. The first notebook you are running will usually run on port 8888. To check the 
  specific port number Jupyter Notebook is running on, refer to the output of the command used to start it:

  Output
  [I NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /home/sammy
  [I NotebookApp] 0 active kernels  
  [I NotebookApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at: http://localhost:8888/
  [I NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to ski  
    
If you are running Jupyter Notebook on a local Linux computer (not on a Droplet), you can simply navigate to 
localhost:8888 to connect to Jupyter Notebook. If you are running Jupyter Notebook on a Droplet, you will need 
to connect to the server using SSH tunneling as outlined in the next section.

At this point, you can keep the SSH connection open and keep Jupyter Notebook running or can exit the app 
and re-run it once you set up SSH tunneling. Let’s keep it simple and stop the Jupyter Notebook process. 
We will run it again once we have SSH tunneling working. To stop the Jupyter Notebook process, press CTRL+C, type Y, 
and hit ENTER to confirm. The following will be displayed:  

Output
[C 12:32:23.792 NotebookApp] Shutdown confirmed
[I 12:32:23.794 NotebookApp] Shutting down kernels

################Step 4 — Connecting to the Server Using SSH Tunneling#############################
  #In this section we will learn how to connect to the Jupyter Notebook web interface using SSH tunneling. 
  Since Jupyter Notebook is running on a specific port on the Droplet (such as :8888, :8889 etc.), 
  SSH tunneling enables you to connect to the Droplet’s port securely.

  #The next two subsections describe how to create an SSH tunnel from 1) a Mac or Linux and 2) Windows. 
  Please refer to the subsection for your local computer.
